# Restaurant Reviews

In this project a static webpage that lacks accessibility is given to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The design must be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It will also be added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## To run

1. Download or clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/camilalopes/restaurant-reviews.git
```
2. Inside the project directory run npm install

3. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, so if you already had a python version installed you can simple:

  * Check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use). For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install.
  * Note: For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

4.  With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`

This tests suite is a personal project but feel free to send me suggestions and corrections. :hearts:
